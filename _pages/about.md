I'm **Zahid**. I completed my undergrad from **Bangladesh University of Engineering 
and Technology**. Currently, I'm pursuing my Ph.D. from **Iowa State University**.
My research interests broadly span the field of **Machine Learning** and 
**Software Engineering**. I have four years of expertise in the industry in 
Software Development, Integration, Validation, Testing, and Deployment. 
I worked on a range of projects in domains such as operating systems, 
data science, machine learning, computer vision and web development. 
Under the guidance of **Dr. Abu Sayed Md. Latiful Hoque** of BUET, I was able 
to get a respectable government fund back in 2020. Our work was published at the **23rd ICCIT**.

Besides computer science, I have interest in history, religion, and philosophy. Reading something is 
like drinking water to me, I can't live without read and think. I am a very good actor,
[lmao](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmC-O1CBsV4&t=631s), and I like to play guitar. <br>

However, If you are doing or thinking of some impossible task and looking for some partner, feel free to contact
me. Have a nice day.
